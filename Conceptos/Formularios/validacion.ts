/* 
For the template-driven approach, you need the directives. 
You can find out their names, by searching for "validator" in the official docs: 
https://angular.io/api?type=directive - everything marked with "D" is a directive 
and can be added to your template.

Additionally, you might also want to enable HTML5 validation (by default, Angular 
disables it). You can do so by adding the ngNativeValidate  to a control in 
your template.
